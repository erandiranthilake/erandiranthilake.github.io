Constructing a model to train a large amount of data may seem like a daunting task, especially when the given data sets need additional pre-processing. More refined data sets available on the website <b>Kaggle.com</b> make this task easy as the data is well structured and explanatory. In addition to providing data, on the same website you can develop code on Notebooks that support well-known programming languages for Machine Learning model development, such as Python.
