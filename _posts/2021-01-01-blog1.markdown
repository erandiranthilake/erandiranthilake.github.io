Constructing a model to train a large amount of data may seem like a daunting task, especially when the given data sets need additional pre-processing. More refined data sets available on the website Kaggle.com make this task easy as the data is well structured and explanatory. In addition to providing data, on the same website you can develop code on Notebooks that support well-known programming languages for Machine Learning model development, such as Python.
