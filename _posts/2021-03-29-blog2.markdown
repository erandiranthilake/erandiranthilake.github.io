<h2>Image Classification</h2>
Image classification refers to the task of categorizing images into N number of predefined classes. Though it seems like an effortless task for an human eye, for an automated system, this is a complicated task that presented with many challenges. As there are number of use cases for developing such a system, computer scientists continue to research in areas to improve image classification. One of such effort is using Deep learning techniques to accomplish the task. It has been successful to use Convolutional Neural Networks to classify images and also accomplish task beyond, such as object detection, object segmentation and instance segmentation.<br><br>

<h2>Convolutional Neural Network</h2>
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is composed of a backbone structure and heads. The central structure function as the main feature extractor which consist of multiple Convolutional layers, filters and pooling layers. The heads in the model composed of the classifiers, predictors, optimizers, and other techniques that used to fine-tune the overall performance of the model.
In image classification Convolutional Neural Networks are preferred over other techniques as they exhibit superior feature extraction capabilities at a lower computational cost.<br>

<h2>Image Classification using CIFAR 10 and CNN model</h2>
A base CNN model is developed using 'Keras' Python library. 
Base model consists of three convolutional layers with 4, 8, 16 neurons in each layer. A filter size of 7 * 7 is used with padding 'same'.
