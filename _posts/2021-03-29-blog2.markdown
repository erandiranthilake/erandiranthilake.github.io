<h2>Image Classification</h2>
Image classification refers to the task of categorizing images into N number of predefined classes. Though it seems like an effortless task for an human eye, for an automated system, this is a complicated task that presented with many challenges. As there are number of use cases for developing such a system, computer scientists continue to research in areas to improve image classification. One of such effort is using Deep learning techniques to accomplish the task. It has been successful to use Convolutional Neural Networks to classify images and also accomplish task beyond, such as object detection, object segmentation and instance segmentation.<br><br>

<h2>Convolutional Neural Network</h2>
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is composed of a backbone structure and heads. The central structure function as the main feature extractor which consist of multiple Convolutional layers, filters and pooling layers. The heads in the model composed of the classifiers, predictors, optimizers, and other techniques that used to fine-tune the overall performance of the model.
In image classification Convolutional Neural Networks are preferred over other techniques as they exhibit superior feature extraction capabilities at a lower computational cost.<br>

<b>Input Layer:</b> Some networks consis of an input layer which load teh images and uses a resulting output to load to convolutional layer. Various operations can take place in this layer as preparations for the next layers, such as, mean-substraction and feature-scaling.
<br>
<b>Convolutional layer:</b>This is the main feature extraction or learning layer in the network. Convolutional layer convolves the input with a set of filters which produces a feature map in the output.
<br>
<b>Pooling layer:</b>This layer is responsible for reducing the spatial dimension of teh input. There is a Pooling layer after each convolutional layer.
<br>
<b>Fully connected layer:</b>This layer consider the input as a single vector and produce a single vector as the output. With in the same layer an activation function such as 'softmax activation' can be used to categorize teh final output.

<h2>Image Classification using CIFAR 10 and CNN model</h2>
A base CNN model is developed using 'Keras' Python library. 
Base model consists of three convolutional layers with 4, 8, 16 neurons in each layer. A filter size of 7 * 7 is used with padding 'same'.
